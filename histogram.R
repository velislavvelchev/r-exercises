# To determine the distribution of salaries over 45000 among employees, we'll create a histogram on the filtered salary variable. 
# The function to create a histogram in gg plot is a geom_histogram. We specify binwidth to be 5000. This will result in a histogram of 13 bins.
# The color and fill arguments control the color of the histogram bins. Color displays the bin edges, or their border, whereas fill is responsible for the color of the bin itself.
# To be able to distinguish the different bins, we include a darkgrey color for the border and a more contrasting light green color for the actual bins.
# We set the alpha parameter to 0.7. Alpha shows transparency and takes values between 0 and 1. 0 means completely transparent, 1 means no transparency.
# With labs we add a custome title, as well as x and y labels.
# With theme_ we choose a custom theme and include custom styling options. A font size of 15, and shrift "serif"
