#Create data frame of high earning employees. Check if the salary column is larger than 70 000.

#Earnings by job position and gender. We group the data by job title, as well as gender. 
# For each we calculate the average salary, and then divide the number by 12, to get an average monthly salary

# Resulting data frame. 
# Overall the salary for different job positions is comparable between female and male workers.
# What we can observe is that the highest paid female employees are members of the senior staff with an yearly salary of over 60025 dollars.
# The highest paid position among male employees is staff, with around 57500 dollars yearly salary. Senior male staff members receive almost the same amount as yearly pay.
# The lowest paid position based on the data is Senior Engineer. Both female and male employees in that category receive an average yearly salary of under 50000 dollars.
# Male Senior engineers have slightly higher salaries, compared to their female counterparts.
